\subsubsection*{a)} \Cref{fig:Time_series_XCH4_XCO2} show the time series of
daily average total column \ch{CO2} and \ch{CH4} from the Caltec TCCON station.
The \ch{XCO2} series has a 
clear seasonal cycle with a peak around February, before the photosynthesis
kicks in. The \ch{XCH4} also exhibit a
seasonal behaviour, with a peak in \ch{XCH4} around November, however the
\ch{XCH4} has more variation. The \ch{XCH4} in November is probably due to the
sink being weaker due to less sunlight, but the sources are still large, since
it is not yet cold enough for the for the organic material in the peat-lands to
be frozen. 

The average annual growth rate during this period for \ch{XCO2} and \ch{XCH4} is
about 2.2 ppm/year and 5778 ppb/year respectively.

\subsection*{b)}
\Cref{fig:scatter_XCO2} shows a scatter plot of \ch{XCO2}, where observations
from the GOSAT satellite is compared against ground based observations from
the Caltec TCCON station with two different geometric co-locations. The 
small region  corresponds to a tight co-location of $\pm$ 5 \degree in longitude
and $\pm$ 2.5 \degree in latitude from the TCCON site. The large region
corresponds to a wider co-location of $\pm$ 10 \degree in longitude and $\pm$
5 \degree in latitude.
