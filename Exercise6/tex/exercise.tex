Air quality has greatly improved over the last two decades due to stricter environmental
policies and more efficient combustion engines. This change has been documented by the 
Ozone Monitoring Instrument onboard the Aura satellite which has been operational since 2004.   
\section*{Global change in \ch{NO2} and \ch{SO2} emission between 2005 and 2019} 
\Cref{fig:OMI_global_2005NO2} shows the time averaged global map of tropospheric 
\ch{NO2} for 2005. High emission regions of \ch{NO2} in 2005 are for the most past anthropogenic. We see elevated values of tropospheric \ch{NO2} over 
China, Central Europe, Eastern United Sates, and also industrial region of South Africa. There are some natural sources of \ch{NO2} over the Amazon and the African rain forrest which is due to wildfires.  

\Cref{fig:OMI_global_2019NO2} shows the 2019 time averaged global tropospheric
map  \ch{NO2}. Comparing 2019 with 2005 there is a major 
decrease in \ch{NO2} emission especially over Europe and the United Sates. China is also 
showing a noticeable decrease since 2005. However India which is currently in undergoing 
major industrialization shows increased \ch{NO2} emission in 2019 compared to 2005.

The \ch{SO2} have large natural sources due to volcanoes in addition to the
anthropogenic sources. The large volcanic sources of \ch{SO2} 
in 2005 (\Cref{fig:OMI_global_2005SO2}) were the Anatahan (Northern Mariana 
islands in the Pacific Ocean), Nyiragongo (Central Congo) and Galapagos 
(in the Pacific Ocean 1200 km west of Ecuador). Considering the anthropogenic 
emission of \ch{SO2} the most noticeable source regions were China 
which has the largest number of coal power plants in the world,the 
Nornickel smelters in Russia, industrial regions in South Africa and the Eastern United States.   

In 2019 \Cref{fig:OMI_global_2005SO2} there were sources of SO2 with volcanic origin in Alaska, in  the Andes mountain range, Nyiragongo and Papua New Guinea. The most interesting changes since 2005 is happening with anthropogenic emissions. China particularly show large reduction in \ch{SO2} emissions. The US as also a noticeable reduction in emissions. India however shows increased \ch{SO2}, due to the establishment of new coal power plants. The emissions from the large point sources in Russia (the Nornickel smelter) and South Africa seems more or less unchanged.

\subsection{Changes in \ch{NO2} and \ch{NO2} over China between 2005 and 2006}

Taking a closer look at the changes in tropospheric \ch{NO2} and \ch{SO2} over China
between 2005 and 2019 (\Crefrange{fig:OMI_global_2005NO2}{fig:OMI_global_2019SO2}). In 2005 there were bright hot spots of \ch{NO2} located
over the major cities in China with average tropospheric
\ch{NO2} 2.5e16 \si{cm^{-1}}. The  The bad air quality has severe consequences 
for peoples health and is estimated to kill about 1 million people in 
China each year \parencite{yue2020stronger}. As a measure to improve the 
air quality the Chinese government implemented the Air Pollution 
Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) from 2013 to 2017. Which 
aimed to reduce the PM 2.5 concentration by 10 \% - 25\% by 2017 in the major cities across China.      

Looking at the situation in 2019 (\Crefrange{fig:OMI_global_2019NO2}{fig:OMI_global_2019SO2}) we see a noticeable reduction in both \ch{NO2} and \ch{SO2}, particularly the \ch{SO2} reducing the \ch{SO2} emission by more than 50 \%. It does seem that measures of the APPCAP have worked especially for \ch{SO2}. \ch{NO2} did not show as a drastic reduction as the \ch{SO2} \ch{NOX} which are still quite large with time averaged \ch{NO2} of around 2.0e16 \si{cm^{-2}} in the large cities.
